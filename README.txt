Project:  Randomized Questions
July 2019

Coded using:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript

From a list of questions, the program is design to ask questions at random when the user clicks the button.
It randomly chooses a question from the entire array list until all questions have been asked, then resets
and starts from the beginning, shuffling throught the questions.
